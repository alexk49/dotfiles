# Vim config

This is my personal vimrc. 

I am fairly new to vim and definitely not even close to being an expert. However, once I got started with it, I found knowing a few basic commands went a long way. 

I generally try and keep it relatively minimal - mainly so I don't spend too long messing around with vim settings! I also try every section documented with comments for my own sanity. 

I found the vimtutor to be the best starting point. Here are some other resources I have found useful for learning (most of which I am still working through): 

* [How to Learn Vim: A Four Week Plan](https://medium.com/actualize-network/how-to-learn-vim-a-four-week-plan-cd8b376a9b85)
* [Learn Vim (the Smart Way)](https://github.com/iggredible/Learn-Vim)
* [How to do 90% of what Plugins Do (With Just Vim)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA2WjJbmmoM&t=408s)
